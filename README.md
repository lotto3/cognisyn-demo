# COGNISYN: Yb-171 Materials Discovery Demo

**Live Demo Dashboard:** [Your Streamlit URL here after deployment]

## Overview

This dashboard demonstrates COGNISYN's quantum-inspired AI approach to materials discovery.

**Mission:** Find Yb-171 quantum computing materials where stability + optical + coherence are ALL high—synergies beyond the Pareto frontier that classical methods cannot reach.

## Key Features

- 🎯 **3D Synergy Space** - Classical trade-offs (Nash) vs COGNISYN synergies (Care)
- ✨ **Novel Discoveries** - 5 materials NOT in baseline databases
- 📊 **Success Metrics** - +56% synergy improvement, 9.9× complexity reduction
- 📅 **Live Demo Scheduling** - Book a demonstration of the full system

## Running Locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Deployment

Deployed on Streamlit Cloud - always available, $0 cost.

## Purpose

This is an **invitation dashboard** showing COGNISYN's approach. For the full system with:
- Real-time quantum operations
- Live 60-day continuous learning
- Interactive agent visualization
- Materials evaluation dashboard

**Schedule a live demo** using the form in the dashboard!

## Technical Details
